# OCRecognition
Sometimes some pictures have texts and we don't want to write those by watching that picture continuously . This app gives you options to choose images from camera/gallery and returns texts that is on that image. When you click on sample image it gives you to choose image and after that you click RUN OCR then it shows that texts on an EditText widget.
